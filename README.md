### Hi my name is Oli and I want to build software that's awesome for everyone! 👨‍🦯🧑🏾👨🏼👩‍🦽🌎💯

For the last three years I've worked on an NHS community project called Digital Inclusion, which aims to teach essential skills and provide opportunities for people who have been excluded from technology. Throughout the project i've gained an acute awareness that many web and software applications fail the very people who could benefit from such technologies the most. I want to change that and build software that is useful, fast and enjoyable for all.
