### Hi my name is Oli and I want to build software that's awesome for everyone!


- 🔭 I’m currently part of the Founders And Coders FAC23 cohort
- 🌱 I’m looking forward to learning Node, React and TypeScript
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to find fresh web development podcasts!
- 💬 Ask me about web dev, neuroscience, philosophy, mushrooms or frogs 🐸!
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olilukejones)



I'm the type of person that enjoys the challenge of constantly learning and solving novel problems. I want to build professional software that is inclusive, fast and enjoyable for all. Throughout my exploration of development I have built projects using Wix and WordPress, Python – PyQT and Django, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Svelte.

Q: What's the deal with the gitHub name?
<br>
A: I'm a big fan of the famous illusion, and I started out with Python before JavaScript!
