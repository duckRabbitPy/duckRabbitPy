### Hi my name is Oli and I want to build software that's awesome for everyone!

- 🔭 I’m currently part of the Founders And Coders FAC23 cohort
- 🌱 I’m looking forward to learning Node, React and TypeScript
- 💬 Ask me about web dev, neuroscience, mushrooms or frogs 🐸!
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olilukejones), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duck_rabbit_py), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/duckRabbit)

I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning and solving novel problems. I want to build professional software that is inclusive, fast and secure for all. Throughout my exploration of development I have built projects using Wix, Python – PyQT and Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and Svelte.

<b>Q</b>: What's the deal with the gitHub name?
<br>
<b>A</b>: I'm a big fan of the famous illusion, and I started out with Python before JavaScript!
